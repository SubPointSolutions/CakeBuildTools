## Field gets auto-generated InternalName in a list

### Problem
While adding field directly to a list via .AddField() syntax, target field gets auto-generated InternalName.

## Explanation
By default SharePoint would generate InternalName for a list scoped fields.
That can be controlled via [Field.AddFieldOptions property](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.sharepoint.spaddfieldoptions.ASPX).

### Solution
While adding field directly to a list FieldDefinition.AddFieldOption should be set to "AddFieldInternalNameHint" so that field would get the right internal name within a list.
