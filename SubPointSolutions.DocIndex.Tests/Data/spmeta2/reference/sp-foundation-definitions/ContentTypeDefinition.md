Content type provision is enabled via ContentTypeDefinition object.

Both CSOM/SSOM object models are supported. 
Provision checks if content type exists by the content type ID, then creates a new conten type. 
You can deploy either single content type or a set using AddContentType() extension method as per following examples.
