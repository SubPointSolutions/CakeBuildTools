Security group provision is enabled via SecurityGroupDefinition object.

Provision checks if object exists looking up it by Name property, then creates a new object. 
You can deploy either single object or a set of the objects using AddSecurityGroup() extension method as per following examples.

In some cases we need to refer to build-in SharePoint security groups, such as associated members, owners and visitors.
That could be done with IsAssociatedMemberGroup, IsAssociatedOwnerGroup and IsAssociatedVisitorsGroup properties.

Once you define suc a group, provision does not do anything but uses these flags to pass them into SecurityGroupLinkDefinition while linking a security group with SharePoint web, list, item, folder or other securable object.
Check SecurityGroupLinkDefinition for more samples on how to use IsAssociatedMemberGroup, IsAssociatedOwnerGroup and IsAssociatedVisitorsGroup properties.
