## The feature with Id 'XXX' is not installed in this farm

### Problem
While working with FeatureDefinition, the following exception may pop up "the feature with Id 'XXX' is not installed in this farm".

## Explanation
We could not reproduce that issue, seems to be farm, service pack or CU-related. Using FeatureDefinition.ForceActivate = true helped.

### Solution
Use FeatureDefinition.ForceActivate = true
